# Hyper-Launch-project-DS-
Student Performance Data Analysis Application:

This project is a simple, interactive data analysis application built using Python. It uses machine learning to predict writing scores based on student attributes. The application includes data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation steps.

---

 Features:

* Reads and processes student performance data (CSV file)
* Handles outliers and missing values
* Performs univariate and bivariate analysis
* Trains a Linear Regression model to predict writing scores
* Visualizes results with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Offers a command*line interface (CLI) for user interaction

---

 Dataset Used:

* Title: Students Performance in Exams

 How to Run:

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells step*by*step to:
   * Load and clean the data
   * Visualize the distributions
   * Train a regression model
   * Evaluate model performance
   * Use the CLI to explore results interactively

---

Model Used:

Linear Regression Model

Evaluation Metrics:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

---

Visualizations:

* Countplot of test preparation courses
* Boxplot of writing scores by gender
* Histogram of writing score distribution
* Actual vs Predicted scores plot
* Residual plot

---

User Interaction:

A simple CLI allows users to:
* View summary statistics
* Choose between visualizations
* View model predictions and evaluation metrics

---

Project Objective:

To develop a simple machine learning pipeline that helps in predicting students' writing scores and provides valuable insights using data visualizations.
